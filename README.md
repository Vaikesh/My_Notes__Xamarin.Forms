# My_Notes__Xamarin.Forms

A small Xamarin.Forms sample to store notes into the local database.

It's very common for a mobile application to use a local SQLite database. The combination of Sqlite.net and Xamarin.Forms makes this very easy. One of the reasons that we choose SQLite as our mobile database is that it's a single file and easily works across platforms. iOS and Android both have the SQLite database engine "built in‚Äù and access to the data is simplified by Xamarin's platform that comes with the SQLite Data Provider.

Here I'm showing how to create a small project to store my notes into the local database. In this app we can save data, view the saved data and also we can update and delete the saved data.
